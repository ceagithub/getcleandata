## Coursera Getting and cleaning data assignment

This repository contains a script, run_analysis.R, which can be used to download, extract and manipulate the Samsung Galaxy S accelerometer and training data. This is the only script needed to replicate the data cleaning process.

The final dataset is uploaded as a .txt file. This can be downloaded and then imported into R using:read.table(file_path, header = TRUE).

The code book, codebook.md, details all of the variables and the processing that has been performed.
