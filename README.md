# Coursera Getting and cleaning data assignment

This repository contains a script, run_analysis.R, which can be used to download, extract and manipulate the Samsung Galaxy S accelerometer and training data. This is the only script needed to replicate the data cleaning process.

The final dataset is uploaded here as tidy2.txt, this can be downloaded and then imported into R using:read.table(file_path, header = TRUE). (I have also submitted this directly via the Coursera submission page.)

The code book, codebook.md, details all of the variables and the processing that has been performed.
